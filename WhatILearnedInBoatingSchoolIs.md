Week 1 Day 1 Notes:

• Welcome


• Syllabus Review


• Understanding GitHub and GitHub Classroom

•	Link creates a root directory and then gives Matt access to it at the same time
•	Adding on just what 2910 works on
•	This is what you submit to employers, a GitHub link
•	Instead of having a media to store code
o	Using GitHub which is made for multiple people working on code
o	Conflict resolution
o	Branching
	Doesn’t screw up main environment
	Takes down test environment not main
•	Thumb drive has pieces of code that need to be worked on
o	Everyone works on something different
o	How do you get that to other people and how do you synch it all up?
o	Send email to person who sent out code
•	GitHub is a cloud file system
•	Git is how to access that file system
•	VCS	
o	Git is an implementation of VCS
o	All downloaded a new something for our devices and it implements a version control
o	Way to manage what release is
o	The number like iOS 13.432 has meaning
o	Track changes over time
	Recall previous versions
•	When pushes and reverts back
•	Get it back to when it was ok
•	Fix what is wrong, push back up, and try again
•	What is git?
o	Cross-platform
o	Almost all companies use git for version control
o	Ma and Pa shops may not implement this, but main companies are using it
•	Git is a Distributed Version Control
o	Daisy chain computers together and then some bit of codes would be on every computer
o	Distribute code across many machines
o	Control allowed no single point failure
	No longer the thumb drive that can crash and burn
	Project would be killed
•	Repositories
o	Used to organize a single “Project”
	Can use it for none project based thing
	Has a repo that controls all his code
	Can contain many things
•	Uses repos for his PhD 
•	Everything can be stored in it
	Nothing special about code, glorified secretarial units
•	Know how to put it in Java format or C# format
•	Organize it in a certain way
	Nothing more than 1s and 0s in certain way to organize something
•	Branching
o	Top line is base line, Main.
	Everyone baseline is kind of different
	If start a new project
•	Get all the basics before logical dev
•	Get it to where you can start coding
•	Before working on the code
o	Should baseline the project
o	Got to get it to where you want to start working
o	Then start making small little changes at a time
o	Doesn’t work? Revert and keep going
o	We should keep making revisions until it fits what we wanted
	Code is so easy to change
	Branching lets you do this
o	Left to right is time for visual 
	Go and grab a copy of the mask
	The box is the baseline
•	Do whatever you want to said mask
•	Everyone grabs a copy of the mask 
o	Baseline never gets changed
o	Everyone just gets a copy of it
	As we go left to right
•	They are working on the code
•	They are in the blue series of working on the code
•	Next Branching
o	In the branch, the box never changes
	Box can represent anything, amazon, etc. 
	Breaks something and realizes it sucks
•	Can just delete it as if nothing had happened
•	Throwing away the sucky idea doesn’t affect the main box
	You can branch off a branch where you like your idea a lot
•	Baseline it for yourself and continue working
•	See a solution and then an enhanced solution
•	Main(master)
o	Would have 2 baselines
	Used to be Master and Slave
	Then moved to Master and Dev
	Now moved to Main and Dev branch
o	Need to make the change in a company that still using the master branch
o	There is only a main branch when first making a repo
o	Want Main branch to have the least amount of pull and request as much as possible 
	Dev will be touched all the time by many things
	Bossman owns the main branch
	Project leads will push to dev branch and deconflict with the other leads
•	Once fully pushed, bossman tells everyone to break it
•	Then it goes live once its good
•	Then they rebranch the Dev branch from the main branch
o	Seems hard in the concept but Git has tools to help us
•	Commits
o	When you commit to branch you do not get pulled in
o	Just commit the code
	When committing you don’t work on the code again
	Gives it to team lead and then submit a code request
•	Then commits to the branch team lead pulled from
o	Change logs are from commit messages 
	Clear Concise commit messages
	WHAT DID YOU DO??
	If you can’t do that then you are doing something wrong
•	Pull Request
o	Hierarchy of who can create and do pull requests
	Someone needs to be in charge
	Person in charge gets fired lol
o	Put protections in place to make sure
	Code Reviews 
	Review committees
	Requesting your code gets pulled onto the branch
•	Merge and Deploy
o	I have 3 changes on the same line
	How do I keep it?
	Who dies?
	Can keep 1 or 2 or rewrite type thing
o	We keep the one everyone decided on
•	GitHub
o	Everything above was the Git Process
o	Implementation of git
o	Cloud based version of git
•	Visualization
o	Forking = Branching
o	Local Machine at the body
o	LM said get me a copy of that branch
o	Pull/fetch me a copy of that
o
